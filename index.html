              <h3>Film Finder</h3>
              <p>
                The motivation for this project was to create an easy-to-use system for finding new movies to watch
                that I know I will like. I've used movie recommender apps in the past, and I always found that they
                would provide very inaccurate and irrelevant recommendations for me. After finding a public list of
                movies and their descriptions, I had the idea of creating an AI model to help me find movies, and from
                there I created this full-stack application.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project has a front-end website and mobile app which allows for a user to swipe left on movies they
                dislike,
                and swipe right on movies that they like. Once they are satisfied, they can click a "Recommend" button,
                which will then
                present the user with a list of movies that they are most likely to enjoy.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the frontend, I used Flutter so that I could deploy this application as a website and as a mobile
                app. I only wrote one
                codebase, but was able to deploy to web, iOS, Android, as well as a desktop app.

                For the backend, I used Django and SQLite to set up a web API using the Django Rest Framework. This
                involved setting up multiple
                authentication-protected API endpoints to allow users to post information about movies they like, as
                well as get information
                about recommended movies.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the recommendation algorithm, I used the scikit-learn library with Python to create an AI
                recommendation model based off
                of movie descriptions. I first vectorized all of the movie descriptions, and then used cosine similarity
                to make a recommendation matrix
                to quickly find similar movies.
              </p>
              <p>
                I deployed the frontend of this project as a website using Firebase,
                and I deployed the API as a web server using Render. More information about this project can be found on
                the
                <a href="https://github.com/AndrewAlbizati/film-finder">GitHub page</a>.

              <h3>School Simulator</h3>
              <p>
                The motivation for this project was to create an organizational management system tailored for a
                university. We wanted to store data about different types of users (e.g. alumni, employees, students)
                and be able to add/modify/remove this data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project has a front-end website which allows for a person to view information about all of users in
                a university. They can also filter by types of users, as well as add or delete users with custom
                parameters.
              </p>
              <p>
                We used Java and Spring Boot to make the front-end of the project, while storing the data in a MySQL
                database hosted on a Raspberry Pi accessible to anyone on the university campus.
                We decided to design it in this way because of the type safety that Java provides, as well as the vast
                array of features present in the Spring Boot framework. MySQL is an easy-to-setup relational database
                which can be nicely mapped to Java classes.
                We used test-driven development throughout the development process in order to ensure correctness and
                eliminate errors.
              </p>
              <p>
                My role in this project was to manage the MySQL database as well as write the Object Relational Mapper
                (ORM) component to convert relational database entries into object oriented Java classes. I used
                Singletons in order to represent the database in Java. More information about this project can be found
                on our <a href="https://github.com/usd-cs/comp305-final-project-sp24-s01s02-jj">GitHub page</a>.

              <h3>Case Claim Discord Bot</h3>
              <p>
                The motivation for this project was to create a better system for our technicians at the USD ITS Help
                Desk to track the tickets that they're working on, but also provide a way for lead technicians to give
                feedback on how those tickets were handled.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project uses Discord to manage the front-end side of things, with a series of commands being
                available to users in order to interact with this bot. Whenever a user types a command, the bot will
                respond in the chat with helpful information.
                For example, if a technicians would like to inform everyone that they're working on a particular ticket,
                they can use the <b>/claim</b> command, which will then send a message displaying the ticket number, and
                prevent other technicians from working on the same ticket.
              </p>
              <p>
                We used Python and the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"> discord.py</a> library to
                handle the processing of commands and interactions.
                Using Python is beneficial because it is taught in the introductory computer science class at USD
                (COMP-110), which makes it accessible to people that work at the helpdesk.

                For handling quality assurance data, we used a MySQL database hosted on a Synology NAS virtual machine
                located inside of the helpdesk's office.
                Using a relational database made it easy to scale as the amount of data increased, and MySQL provides an
                easy-to-use driver for connecting with Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked with a collaborator to develop the ideas for the front-end of the website, however I was the
                primary contributor to writing and testing code as well as maintaining the database.
